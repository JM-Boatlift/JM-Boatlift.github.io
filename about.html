                    <p>
                        In 1999 J &amp; M Boatlift &amp; Repair Inc. was born. It started with a small crew of 2 guys just trying to make
                        their mark into the Marine Construction Industry and today it is a thriving company with multiple
                        employees, office staff, and a 10,000 sq. ft. building with Â¾ of an acre of property in downtown Naples.
                        J &amp; M prides itself on superior quality workmanship and a reputation of completing jobs on schedule
                        and to perfection. Our projects include everything from small repairs and services to single family docks
                        and all the way up to large condominium and commercial projects. No job is too small or too big for J &amp;
                        M.
                        The owner of J &amp; M originally got into the business by working for and became the Manager of the
                        original Marine Lumber Supply here in Naples. With the experience and knowledge of the materials that
                        were being used in the marine construction industry he then started to get his feet wet with
                        understanding and building with other marine contractors on the side until he felt it was time to step
                        out on his own.
                        J &amp; M is now one of the premier Marine Contractors in the Naples area. They are fully licensed in both
                        Collier and Lee County and carry all the proper insurance including but not limited to all the state and
                        federal workers compensation and longshoreman's.
